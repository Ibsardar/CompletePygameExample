# Notes
This game is SUPER MESSY, UNORGANIZED, and LACKING A SOLID GAME ENGINE!
I intended this game to be at least 100 times simpler than it is now, I guess I got a bit carried away. :)
Also note that it is not really complete; it got so messy at one point that I just felt like starting a new, fresh project would be much more beneficial than putting more brute-force into this chaotic game.
