# Notes
This project shows that large scale games/software don't have to be built by experienced professionals or whole companies, but can be built also by individuals who have a passion and drive to achieve a high quality yet satisfying output.

In all honesty, this game is pretty messy underneath and is probably lacking a solid game engine, but the final result can be quite enjoyable. I intended this game to be at least a 100 times simpler than it is now, I guess I got a bit carried away :).
Also note that it is not really complete; the code just got so messy at one point that I just felt like starting a new, fresh project would be much more beneficial than putting more brute-force into this chaotic game. Regardless of the setbacks, please enjoy!
